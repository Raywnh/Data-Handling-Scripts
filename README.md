# Google Sheets Automation || City University of Hong Kong Summer 2022 Internship

Collection of code created in Google Apps Scripts to automate functions in Google Sheets for data organization 

Functions that are automated using the scripts created above include:
  - Moving rows of data based on whether a user's contract has ended
  - Deleting duplicate rows of data by comparing the users' ID numbers
  - Automatically sending emails to remind users to complete the rest of their tasks in a Google Form, and to notify them of whether their contract will end soon.
  - Sorting the data range based on contract end date such that the earliest dates appear at the bottom, which narrows down our search for whether a contract is going to end soon
