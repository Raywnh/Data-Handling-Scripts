# Google Sheets Automation 
Collection of code created in Google Apps Scripts to automate functions in Google Sheets for data organization.

Functions that are automated using the scripts created above include:
  - Moving rows of data based on whether a user's contract has ended
  - Deleting duplicate rows of data by comparing the users' ID numbers
  - Automatically sending emails to remind users to complete the rest of their tasks in a Google Form
  - Sorting the data range based on contract end date such that the earliest dates appear at the bottom, which narrows down our search for whether a contract is going to end
